# based_sortings
Simple implementation of bubble sorting (upgraded) and simple merge sorting (through recursion) for structures.

##Usage:

1) Create a file based on structure used in sortings.cpp (generator included to this repo) 

2) Change path to this file in main() function. 

3) Start code and enjoy your sorted file with calculated elapsed time for each sorting.
